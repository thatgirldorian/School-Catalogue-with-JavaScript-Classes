# School-Catalogue-with-JavaScript-Classes

<h3>Function & Description:</h3>
This is a digital school catalogue I wrote in JavaScript.

It has a parent class called 'school' with the name of each school, the number of students and the level of the school, whether primary, middle or high.

I also added some helpful getters that mention the school policies, tell you which sports team they have and a setter that lets each school choose a random substitute teacher. I worked on this project to strengthen my knowledge of JavaScript classes and it was a lot of fun.
